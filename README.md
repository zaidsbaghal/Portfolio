# Intro
This is version 1.0 of my personal portfolio that I built when I first started learning web development. I have come a long way since I first built this but is still one my proudest achievements as it was the first thing I ever built from start to finish. Currently I am devloping a more modern website with all the skills I learned after building this one. 

## Things I learned
* HTML/CSS
* Jekyll
* Javacript basics
* Responsive web design
